## Prompt

Create Gold Tier specification for Personal AI Employee - Hackathon 0. Extend Silver Tier with: cross-domain integration (personal + business), Odoo accounting integration via MCP/JSON-RPC, social media integrations (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X), multiple MCP servers (min 4: email, social, Odoo, browser), weekly audits & CEO Briefing, error recovery & graceful degradation, comprehensive audit logging, Ralph Wiggum loop for multi-step autonomy, complete documentation. All AI as Agent Skills, HITL for sensitive actions, 40+ hours implementation.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification with 6 user stories (Cross-Domain P1, Odoo P2, Social P3, Multiple MCP P4, Weekly Audits P5, Error Recovery/Ralph Wiggum P6), 12 functional requirements, 10 success criteria (all quantified), 7 key entities. Out of scope clearly documented (Platinum Tier features). Specification quality checklist created and passed validation (all items passed).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Gold Tier specification ready for planning
- 🧪 Tests: Specification validated against quality checklist (all 16 items passed)
- 📁 Files: specs/003-gold-tier/spec.md, checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan for architecture design
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification captures all Gold Tier requirements without implementation details; clear Silver Tier prerequisites; Ralph Wiggum loop per Handbook Section 2D
